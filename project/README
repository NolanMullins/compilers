Problem
**********************************
Build a program to take in a C- file and parse it down in to an 
abstract syntax tree, print the tree to stdout in an indented, 
readable format.


*******
Setup
*******
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk openjdk-8-jre
sudo apt install jflex
sudo apt install cup

*******
Compile
*******
make


*******
Running
*******
java -classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. <flags> <file>

-a -> outputs abstract syntax tree
-s -> outputs symantic analysis results
-c -> outputs compiled .tm file

**********************************
Test plan
**********************************
We used an incremental development strategy, slowly 
introducing more complex C- programs for parsing.
We started with basic single declarations, then introduced
function declarations and comments. Once this foundation
was in place we began to increase the complexity of functions
and assignments. 

Test Cases:
0-9.cm all contain documented test cases

We also tested our program against the sample files provided.
